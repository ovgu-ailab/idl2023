# Reading Assignment: Graph Neural Networks

Distill.pub has two blog posts that introduce the topic:

1. [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/)

2. [Understanding Convolutions on Graphs](https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/)

Please go through both!


For further optional reading, these books conver the topic in more depth:

- The [Graph Representation Learning Book by William L. Hamilton](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/) is a whole book on the topic. (recommended sections: 1, 5, and 5.1)

- [Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction by Kevin P. Murphy](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) covers Graph Embeddings in Chapter 23.

Please also share any valuable resources that you come across!
